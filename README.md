# prime-numbers

Vanilla js app to determine if a number is prime or composite

JavaScript

This app took longer than I thought it would. I had find ways to account for numbers that don't fit in the prime/composite dichotomy (zero, one, decimals, and negative numbers). It was also my first time to stray from the trusty for loop and give the while loop a go.
